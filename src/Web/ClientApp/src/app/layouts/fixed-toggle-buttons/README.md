- abilities (top-left): Expand and collapse the component named abilities
- wallet (top-right): Expand and collapse the component named wallet
- spellcasting (bottom-right): Exapand and collapse the component named spellcasting

This is where you declare the direction of the buttons and their behaviour, for example: `death-saves` closes when `abilities` opens
