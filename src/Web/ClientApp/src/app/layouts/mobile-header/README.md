## Purpose

Header that appears only in the mobile version and includes basic information about the character that is worth keeping fixed in the design.
E.g. character character name, level, class, race, alignment.... (Equivalent to the information at the top right of the original DnD character sheet)
This header can be changed with a button to show the rest of the information.
